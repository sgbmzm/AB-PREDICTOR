    "The code of this software was written by Yehudit Bohrer, and improved by Dr. Simcha Gershon Bohrer.\n",
    "Any use of this software will be made non-profit, and with appropriate credit.\n",
    "All the data on AB Groups and their modals were taken from the published data on the \"Jewish DNA\" website at the following address:\n",
    "https://jewishdna.net/ModalsAB.html\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the software do?\n",
    "This software receives an input of the first 37 STR markers (according to their order in FTDNA format) , and compares it against the first 37 STR markers in the AB Groups STR model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result obtained: 5 AB Groups to which the person is most compatible.\n",
    "Usually, the person fits the first group in the list of results, but sometimes he fits the second or third match, etc.\n",
    "For example: if the person matches the first result with a difference of 5 and the second result with a difference of 20, it is clear that he belongs to the first group. However, if the person matches the first result with a difference of 5 and the second result with a difference of 6, the person may belong to the second group.\n",
    "This software gives excellent results, but still the results should be treated with a little suspicion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional instructions, and additional details:\n",
    "You can enter more than 37 markers, but the result will only refer to the first 37 markers.\n",
    "You can enter less than 37 markers, but the match will be less good.\n",
    "For example: if you only use the first 12 markers, you can use the software as usual.\n",
    "But, if you want to use only markers 13-24, you must put a zero (0) in place of each of the first 12 markers for this software to calculate correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The markers must be inserted in FTDNA format from left to right, with each marker separated from the marker before it by a tab. For example: 12 23 14 10/\n",
    "Markers that have several alleles (such as the DYS464 marker which usually contains 4 alleles), each allele should be separated from the next allele by a middle dash. For example: 12-14-16-17.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the event that the subject has a marker that contains an unusual number of alleles (such as 6 alleles for the DYS464 marker), or a marker that contains an incomplete number (such as 12.3), this marker will not be calculated at all in the measurement of matching to any group. Instead, the software will go away this person from the model arbitrarily, in three steps.\n",
    "In the event that the subject has a deletion of a certain marker [such as having nool or 0] the comparison will not refer to this marker.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the list of results, the groups that have Ashkenazim are marked as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) = Ashkenazi group\n",
    "(A+S) = a group that has Ashkenazim and Sephardim\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if you enter the results of a completely Ashkenazi person, and get a first match to a group that does not contain Ashkenazim, this person probably belongs to the second match and not to the first match.'''\n",
